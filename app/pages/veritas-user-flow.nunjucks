	While Veritas was working on an initial release of their app, they were also aware that there were still many other features that could be included, and multiple user touchpoints that could be leveraged, at a later date. Journey mapping helped Veritas visualize their usersâ€™ path from waitlist to app on-boarding and beyond, providing valuable insight into where Veritas could engage consumers, even before they download the app.

	<p class="body">
	At key touchpoints, ideas for potential user engagement and communication were considered and documented.
